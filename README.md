## Installation Instructions

Tired of waiting until the next version comes out? Here is a tutorial on how to compile the very newest version yourself:
In this Fork, if you want to make changes by yourself with IDE you just Run `gradlew eclipse` on windows or `./gradlew eclipse` directly in the terminal where you extract these files.
If you want to build mod, then run `gradlew build` or `./gradlew build` and check `/build/libs/`.
You don't have to download forge 1.7.10 src or need to run `setupDecompWorkspace` or need to download extra files for lib, in this Fork.

2. Slap this mod's `src` into the project's root directory
3. Pray
